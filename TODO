All Scripts
   [ ] Add total runtime spent processing a batch.

PrepareDB
  [ ] Fix Verbosity. Complex... Talk to me in Discord.
  [ ] Read fasta files using Bio. This will also help with fastq.gz/.fq.gz extraction
  [ ] Experiment with using MapReduce to speed up AA dedupe.
  [ ] Incorporate HammingDist dedupe.
  [ ] Move the dup hits table from sequences DB to hits DB?
  [ ] Incorporate .fastq/.fq.gz extraction @low
  [ ] Regex taxa filenames so they don't bork the script. @low
  [ ] Allow path to maintain sequence ID for references. @low

Hmmsearch
  [ ] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -vv 
  
BlastPalDB
  [ ] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -v
  [ ] Can someone check and see if the Blast External is sorted to do genes with most Hmmsearch results first?
  [ ] Should also add a post blast sort to start the heaviest workloads first.

ReporterDB
  [ ] Incorporate HamDups into Exonerate.
  [ ] Experiement with splitting largest work units into multiple work units. 

mafft
  [ ] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -v.

Pal2Nal
  [x] Full blown rewrite. Python version is at least 4x slower than Perl version. (A lot of poor design decisions in Pal2Nal.py) Perhaps rewrite in Golang or Rust? @done (31-10-22 22:10)
  
OutlierCheck
  [ ] Add additional outlier check methodology.
  
CrossContamination
  [ ] TODO
  
MergeGenes
  [ ] So slow! Please speed up. Multiprocessing?
  
Finalize Dataset Section
  1. Heavy refactor and script combination
     [ ] TaxaKick.py
     [ ] ColumnTrim.py
     [ ] StopCodonRemove.py
     [ ] Renamer.py
     [ ] Concatenate.py
