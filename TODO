TODO
-----------
HIGH PRIORITY!!!!
	[ ] Allow Pal2Nal through MergeOverlap to function when Reference NT sequences are absent.
	[ ] Move orthosets folder out of PhyMMR to the same level as the phymmr and PhyMMR folder. Update paths to reflect this.
	[ ] Populate ReadMe with detailed instructions and examples. (assigned to Kevin)

__main__.py:
 [x] Use upper cases for sub commands @done (31-10-22 23:15)
 [ ] Write a proper description for the software
 [x] Transform filenames to lowercase @done (01-11-22 01:18)
 List of dir as input:
   [x] PrepareDB @done (31-10-22 23:49)
   [x] mafft @done (01-11-22 00:36)
   [x] FlexCull @done (01-11-22 00:13)
   [x] OutlierCheck @done (01-11-22 00:19)
   [x] MergeOverlap @done (01-11-22 00:09)
 Test new input style:
   [ ] PrepareDB
   [x] mafft @done (01-11-22 02:54)
   [x] FlexCull @done (01-11-22 02:39)
   [x] OutlierCheck @done (2022-11-01 22:10)
   [x] MergeOverlap @done (2022-11-01 23:08)
   
All Scripts
   [ ] Add total runtime spent processing a batch.

PrepareDB
  [ ] Fix Verbosity. Complex... Talk to me in Discord.
  [ ] Read fasta files using Bio. This will also help with fastq.gz/.fq.gz extraction
  [ ] Experiment with using MapReduce to speed up AA dedupe.
  [ ] Incorporate HammingDist dedupe.
  [ ] Move the dup hits table from sequences DB to hits DB?
  [ ] Incorporate .fastq/.fq.gz extraction @low
  [ ] Regex taxa filenames so they don't bork the script. @low
  [ ] Allow path to maintain sequence ID for references. @low

Hmmsearch
  [x] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -vv
  
BlastPalDB
  [x] Fix Verbosity
  [ ] Can someone check and see if the Blast External is sorted to do genes with most Hmmsearch results first?
  [ ] Should also add a post blast sort to start the heaviest workloads first.

ReporterDB
  [ ] Incorporate HamDups into Exonerate.
  [ ] Experiement with splitting largest work units into multiple work units. 

mafft
  [x] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -v.

Pal2Nal
  [x] Full blown rewrite. Python version is at least 4x slower than Perl version. (A lot of poor design decisions in Pal2Nal.py) Perhaps rewrite in Golang or Rust? @done (31-10-22 22:10)
  
OutlierCheck
  [ ] Add additional outlier check methodology.
  
CrossContamination
  [ ] TODO
  
MergeGenes
  [ ] So slow! Please speed up. Multiprocessing?
  
Finalize Dataset Section
  1. Heavy refactor and script combination
     [ ] TaxaKick.py
     [ ] ColumnTrim.py
     [ ] StopCodonRemove.py
     [ ] Renamer.py
     [ ] Concatenate.py
