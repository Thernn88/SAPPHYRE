PrepareDB
  [ ] Fix Verbosity
  [ ] Read fasta files using Bio. This will also help with fastq.gz/.fq.gz extraction
  [ ] Experiment with using MapReduce to speed up AA dedupe.
  [ ] Incorporate HammingDist dedupe.
  [ ] Move the dup hits table from sequences DB to hits DB?
  [ ] Incorporate .fastq/.fq.gz extraction @low
  [ ] Regex taxa filenames so they don't bork the script. @low
  [ ] Allow path to maintain sequence ID for references. @low

Hmmsearch
  [ ] Fix Verbosity
  
BlastPalDB
  [ ] Fix Verbosity

ReporterDB
  [ ] Incorporate HamDups into Exonerate.
  [ ] Experiement with splitting largest work units into multiple work units. 

mafft
  [ ] Fix Verbosity

Pal2Nal
  [x] Full blown rewrite. Python version is at least 4x slower than Perl version. (A lot of poor design decisions in Pal2Nal.py) Perhaps rewrite in Golang or Rust? @done (31-10-22 22:10)
  
OutlierCheck
  [ ] Add additional outlier check methodology.
  
CrossContamination
  [ ] TODO
  
MergeGenes
  [ ] So slow! Please speed up. Multiprocessing?
