TODO
-----------
HIGH PRIORITY!!!!
	[x] Allow Pal2Nal through MergeOverlap to function when Reference NT sequences are absent. @done (~08-11-22)
	[x] Move orthosets folder out of PhyMMR to the same level as the phymmr and PhyMMR folder. Update paths to reflect this. @done (04-11-22 14:15)
	[ ] Populate ReadMe with detailed instructions and examples. (assigned to Kevin)

MergeOverlap
   [ ] Experiment with filling internal gaps with X characters and doing full merge. This should prevent Mafft from moving sequences improperly. Would prevent a second run of Merge.

__main__.py:
 [x] Use upper cases for sub commands @done (31-10-22 23:15)
 [ ] Write a proper description for the software
 [x] Transform filenames to lowercase @done (01-11-22 01:18)
 List of dir as input:
   [x] PrepareDB @done (31-10-22 23:49)
   [x] mafft @done (01-11-22 00:36)
   [x] FlexCull @done (01-11-22 00:13)
   [x] OutlierCheck @done (01-11-22 00:19)

   [x] MergeOverlap @done (2022-11-01 23:08)
   
All Scripts
   [ ] Add total runtime spent processing a batch.
   [x] Changeover to pathlib. @done (17-11-22)
PrepareDB
  [x] Memory efficiency pass @done (20-11-22)
  [x] Fix Verbosity. Complex... Talk to me in Discord. @done
  [ ] Read input files using Bio.
  [ ] Dedupe in rust. (At least AA).
  [ ] Incorporate HammingDist dedupe.
  [ ] Move the dup hits table from sequences DB to hits DB?
  [x] Incorporate .fastq/.fq.gz extraction @done
  [ ] Regex taxa filenames so they don't bork the script. @low
  [ ] Allow path to maintain sequence ID for references. @low

Hmmsearch
  [x] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -vv
  
BlastPalDB
  [x] Fix Verbosity @done
  [x] Added smart compression. Reduced memory and storage footprints by >10x. Brought large speed increase as well. @done
  [x] Can someone check and see if the Blast External is sorted to do genes with most Hmmsearch results first? @done
  [x] Should also add a post blast sort to start the heaviest workloads first.@done

ReporterDB
  [ ] Incorporate HamDups into Exonerate.
  [ ] Experiement with splitting largest work units into multiple work units. 

mafft
  [x] Fix Verbosity. Lock gene prints behind -v. @done

Pal2Nal
  [x] Full blown rewrite. Python version is at least 4x slower than Perl version. (A lot of poor design decisions in Pal2Nal.py) Perhaps rewrite in Golang or Rust? @done (31-10-22 22:10)
  [ ] Fix error prints to always tell which gene had the error!

FlexCull
  [ ] Memory efficiency pass
  
OutlierCheck
  [ ] Memory efficiency pass
  [ ] Add additional outlier check methodology.
